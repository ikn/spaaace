A game about crashing into enemies and dodging rocks.

This was made for a 48-hour competition; this version has some changes made
afterwards, including performance improvements, the ability to freely scale
the window, better menus, controller support, crash damage and powerups.

Theme: cowardice.  Connection to theme: instead of racing, you're trying to
destroy your opponents, which is in some way cowardly or something.  ...Yeah, I
know.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

    PLAYING

The aim of the game is to push opponents into rocks or the boundary to get them
to blow up.  Crashing into rocks causes an amount of damage dependent on the
force of the impact, while crossing the boundary results in instant death;
crashing into opponents doesn't cause any damage.

The remaining player after all others have died gets a point; the first to 10
wins.  In 1-player mode, just try to last as long as you can.

The coloured spheres are powerups, with the following effects:
 - blue: temporary immunity to crash damage.
 - red: temporary mass increase - this makes it easier to push stuff, but
        increases the force of (and so damage taken in) crashes, so be careful
 - green: temporary speed increase.
 - white: restore up to 50% health.
 - orange: explodes, pushing away everyone but the player that collects it.

The 'graphics' control on the title screen affects the FPS, the amount of
particles, image rotation smoothness, whether images are used, and the number
of sounds playing simultaneously.

    CONTROLS

        INTERFACE

Keyboard:

enter, space: select option in menus

F11, alt + enter: fullscreen

Xbox 360 controller (any that are plugged in work):

Other controllers should work too: one button will act as A above, one as B
above, and a D-pad, analogue stick or pair of triggers as the left analogue
stick above.

        PLAYERS

Any plugged in controllers are used to move the first players, then the
following keyboard keys are used for players in order:

arrow keys
WASD
numpad arrow keys
IJKL

WASD and IJKL work for the Dvorak keyboard layout too (,AOE and CHTN).
