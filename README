A game about crashing into enemies and dodging rocks.

This was made for a 48-hour competition; this version has some fixes made
afterwards, including performance improvements and the ability to freely scale
the window, but no major changes to the gameplay or featureset.

Theme: cowardice.  Connection to theme: instead of racing, you're trying to
destroy your opponents, which is in some way cowardly or something.  ...Yeah, I
know.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    PLAYING

The aim of the game is to push opponents into the boundary to increase your
score; the first to 10 wins.  In 1-player mode, just try to last as long as you
can.

The 'graphics' control on the title screen affects the FPS, the amount of
particles, image rotation smoothness and whether images are used.

Controls:

Any plugged in controllers are used to move the first players, then the
following keyboard keys are used for players in order:
    arrow keys
    WASD
    numpad arrow keys
    IJKL
pause: escape, start on any controller
fullscreen: F11, alt + enter
minimise: F10
