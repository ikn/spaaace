A game about crashing into enemies and dodging rocks.

This was made for a 48-hour competition; this version has some changes made
afterwards, including performance improvements, the ability to freely scale
the window, better menus, controller support, crash damage and powerups.

Theme: cowardice.  Connection to theme: instead of racing, you're trying to
destroy your opponents, which is in some way cowardly or something.  ...Yeah, I
know.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

    PLAYING

The aim of the game is to push opponents into the boundary to increase your
score; the first to 10 wins.  In 1-player mode, just try to last as long as you
can.

The 'graphics' control on the title screen affects the FPS, the amount of
particles, image rotation smoothness, whether images are used, and the number
of sounds playing simultaneously.

    CONTROLS

        INTERFACE

Keyboard:

pause: escape, start on any controller
fullscreen: F11, alt + enter
minimise: F10

Xbox 360 controller (any plugged in controllers work):

stick above.
