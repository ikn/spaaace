A game about crashing into enemies and dodging rocks.

This was made for a 48-hour competition; this version has some fixes made
afterwards, including performance improvements and the ability to freely scale
the window, but no major changes to the gameplay or featureset.

    PLAYING

The aim of the game is to push opponents into the boundary to increase your
score; the first to 10 wins.  In 1-player mode, just try to last as long as you
can.

The 'graphics' control on the title screen affects the amount of particles and
sprite rotation smoothness.

Controls:

player 1: WASD
player 2: arrow keys
player 3: numpad arrow keys
player 4: IJKL
fullscreen: F11, alt + enter
minimise: F10
